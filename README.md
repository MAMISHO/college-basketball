### Sample application built using the [Enyo.js](http://github.com/enyojs/enyo) JavaScript framework

__See it in action [here](http://bball.collaborap.com/debug.html)__

This application is available for learning purposes only. It is designed to show some possible implementation choices using the available framework tools for retrieving and manipulating data objects, and for combining this data for use with a somewhat complex view and interface.

This application is in no way affiliated with any college, university or the [NCAA](http://ncaa.com). It uses a public _JSONP_ API to retrieve college basketball tournament seedings and results for the given year(s).
